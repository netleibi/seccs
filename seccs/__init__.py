"""sec-cs --- the SECure Content Store.

This module provides an implementation of the secure content store data
structure introduced in [LS16]_.

`sec-cs` allows secure and efficient storage of contents in an existing
key-value database, providing the following features:

    * Confidentiality:
        Stored contents are securely encrypted using a symmetric key.
    * Authenticity:
        `sec-cs` guarantees authenticity of all stored contents,
        irrespective of gurantees of the underlying database.
    * Storage Efficiency:
        Data deduplication strategies are applied to all
        stored contents. When storing new contents, overlapping parts of
        existing contents are automatically reused as to avoid redundancy.
        Storage costs of an n-bytes content that differs only slightly from an
        existing content are in O(log n).
        
Note:
    The only `sec-cs` implementation currently included in this module is called
    :class:`SecCSLite`. While it is likely suitable for many projects and can be
    used as is, it is actually intended as a base class for a much more powerful
    variant, :class:`SecCS`, which makes some slight changes to the internal
    storage structure and will be published in the near future.

    """Secure Content Store `lite`.

    Basic implementation of the Secure Content Store data structure, supports
    only insertion (put), retrieval (get) and deletion (delete) of contents.

    Args:
        chunk_size (int): Target chunk size, i.e., expected size of all chunks
            stored in the database.
        database: Persistent database used as backend. Can be any object with
            a dict-like interface, i.e., any object implementing the operations
            __getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__ and __contains__.
        crypto_wrapper (:class:`crypto_wrapper.BaseCryptoWrapper`): Crypto
            wrapper object that specifies cryptographic operations to be applied
            to data stored in the `database`.
        chunking_strategy (Optional[:class:`fastchunking.BaseChunkingStrategy`]):
            Chunking strategy that shall be applied to contents. Defaults to
            Rabin-Karp-based content defined chunking with 48-bytes window size.
        reference_counter (Optional[:class:`seccs.rc.BaseReferenceCounter`]):
            Reference counting strategy. By default, reference counters are
            stored in `database` under keys `key` || `"r"`, where `key` is the key
            whose references are counted.
        **kwargs: Extra keyword arguments that you should NOT use unless you
            really, really know what you are doing, e.g.:

            * length_to_height_fn: Function that resolves content lengths to
              appropriate chunk tree heights. May be used to modify the
              multi-level chunking approach performed by default, e.g., to
              degrade it to single-level chunking or similar.
            * height_to_chunk_size_fn: Function that computes the target chunk
              size for a specific level (height) of a chunk tree. May be used
              to create `imbalanced` chunk trees.

    Raises:
        seccs.UnsupportedChunkSizeError: If the chosen chunk size would create
            superchunk nodes with less than two expected children as efficiency
            guarantees would fail in this case (see [LS16]_).
